# autoconf

The  requirements for running this code are the same as DARTS except the version of Pytorch

all the code use python 3.7 and pytorch 1.8-1

The Imagenet experiment is mainly carried using pc-darts

and  the cifar10 dataset based model is in darts++ folder

Also we did lose the checkpoints of the results in the paper due to server malfunctionning. But we have rerun the cifar-10 experiment and the new optimal result is even better. We are sorry for that inconvient.
Also one must understand that the proposed method is based on existing method that are affected by randomness so searching from scratch may not always lead to the same architecture. Nonetheless we include our best architectures which we used to produce the result in the paper
